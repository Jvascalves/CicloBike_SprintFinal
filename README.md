# Saving Google Maps Routes in Local Storage

The main goal here is to create a collection of routes and save it in the browser's local storage.

Users can also choose one of the saved routes and see the bike directions based on their current location.

It's also possible to have a forecast for durations and calories (bike only) for each route.

Appart from that, users can favorite any route.

You can run the application here:
